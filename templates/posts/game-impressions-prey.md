Prey: first person combat/exploration with melee, shooty-shooty, and sci-fi magic powers. Features a complex inventory and perk trees. Features limited resources and a lot of scrounging. Direct spiritual successor to System Shock, which is basically the same genre as Deus Ex.

Set on a space station where almost everyone is dead; your inner nihilist might enjoy having it all to yourself. The social aspect is somewhat muted. The enemies are mostly weird black monsters and corrupted robots.

Much of the attraction is in the setting, the ambience, ornamented by the plot, which I enjoyed a _lot_. The writing in this game is amazingly good. It's very self-consistent, and gives you just the right amount of hints to figure things out before revealing them. The sci-fi part is also really well thought-out and researched. The premises underlying the plot are some of my favorite sci-fi themes. I won't be spoiling it though.

The game gives you a variety of toys for dealing with obstacles and enemies. The first non-wrench weapon you find is the most ridiculous: it shoots gobs of instantly-solidifying goo that binds enemies or can create walkable/climbable surfaces, you can block paths, create ledges, climb anywhere with enough creativity, etc. Other weapons are less interesting, which is fine because the game lets you kill in various other ways, using the stuff you can find lying around, or repair and make use of.

There are optional sci-fi themed "magic powers". Mostly boring, but some are really cool. Again, won't be spoiling it.

There are nice perks and toys for movement, which I won't be spoiling. You find more throughout the game, and they let you get pretty much anywhere. You _want_ good movement because the level design is awesome, featuring a lot of verticality and hidden paths. Oh, and there are nice zero-g sections where you freely maneuver in 3D.

Similarly to System Shock and Deus Ex, you can't fully develop the character in a single playthrough, so it invites a replay to try different approaches. I'm replaying it right now. This is very YMMV and depends on how well you have explored the game, and developed the character, the first time around.

My advice would be to play on "hard" or maybe even "nightmare", and enable the optional modifiers such as traumas and oxygen. The game allows you to "power" through fights by spamming medkits and such. Some of the difficulty comes from supplies being limited. It appears to be tuned for impatient players, and is inherently easier for folks like us who tend to explore and scrounge everything. The optional modifiers add flavor rather than difficulty; the game has features, whether in gameplay or writing, that make more sense when they're enabled as a gameplay mechanic.
