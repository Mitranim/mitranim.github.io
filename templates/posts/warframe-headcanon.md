## Non-primes existed in Orokin times {#non-primes}

{{imgBox "/images/warframe/braton.png" "Braton"}}

{{imgBox "/images/warframe/braton_prime.png" "Braton Prime"}}

Prime Warframes and weapons were made exclusively in the Orokin times, while non-primes can be manufactured from scratch right now. Non-primes could be cheap knock-offs of the originals, but they could also _be_ the originals, the prototypes, later refined with superior materials and designs {{emoji "‚ú®" ""}}.

The Old War cutscenes feature prime Warframes and weapons. However, the Leverian, Chains of Harrow, and the Deadlock Protocol specifically place non-primes in the Orokin era. Both Harrow and Protea, found in their respective quests, are non-primes that have stuck around for hundreds of years.

One sensible explanation is that most Warframes and weapons started off as non-prime prototypes. Many weapons are specifically said to be of Tenno design, implying later refinement by the Orokin. Several Warframes are attributed directly to prominent Orokin or Archimedians, but there's no reason why they couldn't have iterated on the design. Some weapons, like the Euphona Prime, may have started off as a prime; alternatively, the non-prime prototype blueprints may have been lost.

## Corpus and Grineer ships have decoy reactors for Tenno sabotage raids {#decoy-reactors}

Infested versions of Corpus and Grineer ships tend to be dark, implying running on reserve power. Reserve power implies reserve reactors. We supposedly sabotage a ship's main reactor, but does that really detonate the ship? On the Grineer ships and pre-Deadlock Corpus ships, there's no countdown after completing the objective. On post-Deadlock Corpus ship, doing it the {{emoji "üî•" "hot"}} way starts a countdown, but does it really explode at the end? Doing it the {{emoji "‚ùÑÔ∏è" "cold"}} way completes the mission without a countdown, and therefore without a detonation. One would expect that after so many raids, they would start installing decoy reactors, possibly in a ship section that can be jettisoned away.

## Mass-produced enemy units are ignorant about the Tenno threat level {#mass-ignorance}

{{imgBox "/images/warframe/jackal.jpg" "Jackal"}}

Corpus and Grineer infantry, as well as mass-produced bosses such as the Jackal, seem suicidally brave when facing Tenno.

Think about it. The kill count of an individual Tenno often ranges somewhere in the millions. They're a one-man army that can _personally_ genocide an entire nation, _and did so_. They can't be killed for good and regenerate from any injuries. They're liable to dismember you within seconds of visual contact, or without visual contact, and that's _going easy_. They will hack off your limbs and watch you bleed to death, infest you with techno-bio-parasites for more suffering, burn you to death, melt your flesh with horrible chemicals, crush you into smooth paste with force fields, mind control you into killing squadmates and friends, and more. And laugh while doing so. And then they _come in groups_.

They have pets to match. They show up on the Infested Derelict where nobody dares to set foot without an army, looking for _cuddly pets_: feral kavats, transformed by hundreds of years among the Infestation into an animal equivalent of Warframes. The kavats get further augmented with Orokin Reactors and mods. They can't be killed for good and regenerate from any injuries. These "pets" are liable to tear you in half and feast on you in the middle of a battlefield. And the Tenno consider them _cute_ and hold fashion contests.

A sane person's response in the face of this overwhelming threat? Run away! As far as you can, as fast as you can! Tribunal? Punishment for disobeying orders? Probably better than horrible dismemberment _right now_. Band with your ship's crew and abscond together! Become a rogue faction or join the Perrin Sequence! Try to ally with the Tenno if you can, because you lost the alternatives the moment they showed up.

Meanwhile, what do we see?

The Jackal:

* "Pathetic organics require sterilization."
* "Tenno victory probability: inconceivable."
* At 1/4 health: "Trivial threat detected."

The Raptors:

* "Analyzing Threat Intelligence: Under-developed." (True but won't save it.)
* "Analyzing Threat Weaponry: Unimpressive."
* "Analyzing Threat Vitality: Target Death Imminent."

The Sergeant:

* "From pods you have come, in caskets you will go!"
* "Fashion victims about to become murder victims!"
* "This [FRAME] will look good on my wall!"

Corpus infantry (translated):

* "Nullify targets!"
* "Exterminate hostiles!"
* "Engaging fighting protocols!"

Grineer infantry (translated):

* "Warframe spotted!"
* "It's the Tenno, attack!"
* "Die, you Tenno son-of-a-bitch!"
* "Don't let them get away!"

One logical explanation is that the mass-cloned or mass-manufactured units are intentionally kept ignorant about the Tenno threat level. They know about Tenno in general, but in the best traditions of military propaganda, must be led to believe that the Tenno are weak and cowardly (but somehow also responsible for many atrocities).

What about the robots, such as the Jackal and the Raptors? Let's say their artificial intelligence is too complicated and lifelike; Corpus couldn't separate the combat data from the emotional trauma caused by the Tenno raids. Alternatively, after analyzing the combat data, the onboard intelligence correctly concludes the probability of victory against Tenno to be around 0.0001%, and the most effective combat tactic is to play dead until the Tenno leave, nullifying its combat effectiveness. Leaving the Corpus with no choice but to reset the personality data every time.

## Derelict kavats are the animal equivalent of Warframes {#kavats}

## Vauban is some Corpus guy pretending to be a Warframe {#vauban}

{{imgBox "/images/warframe/vauban_prime.png" "Vauban Prime"}}

## Human-looking Tenno associates are "Peaceframes" {#tenno-peaceframes}

Relays have many human-looking Tenno or Tenno associates. They can be relay staff, syndicate members, and Tenno rescue targets which Lotus specifically calls "Tenno operatives". More importantly, they're found in something labeled "Warframe Cryopods".

The most literal interpretation is that these guys are fully-fledged Tenno, using Warframes specifically designed for civil life. Those "Peaceframes" appear human, but who knows what's under that visor and body-tight suit? Since they're found in cryopods, it follows that some Tenno wake up in Peaceframes rather than Warframes like Excalibur. Those guys went on to build relays, research technologies, and provide support to the combat Tenno.

If these guys are remote-controlled like regular Warframes, their Operators might still be sleeping through the Second Dream. They might even believe themselves to be human!

## Hypothesis: Operators are "Peaceframes" {#operator-peaceframes}

{{imgBox "/images/warframe/somatic_link.jpg" "Somatic Link"}}

See the above on Tenno associates and Peaceframes. If Operators were also Peaceframes, this would explain a lot!

* Halted aging.
* Ability to modify appearance, voice, apparent gender.
* Ability to survive in vacuum, as seen in the infested Corpus ship tileset.
* Apparent lack of human support facilities on the Orbiter.
* Apparent ability to sit awake in the transference chair for indefinite periods of time, without any regular human needs.

In the Second Dream we supposedly awaken as the "real" puppeteer behind the golem. It's not unreasonable to suggest that there's another body _behind_ the Operator, for real this time. But let's keep it simple and suppose the Operator is the "final" body. How could it be a Peaceframe?

Option 1: fusion. Chains of Harrow establishes that a Tenno can fuse with a Warframe, transferring from the original human body. Perhaps every Tenno transfered to a specially prepared, younger-looking Peaceframe.

Option 2: Helminth. Just like Excalibur Umbra, the Tenno may have been infested with the Helminth to become frame-like. Warframes are known to lose their sanity in the process, but for the Tenno we can handwave it through Void magicks.

Our Operator never makes any statements contradicting any of this, but even if they did, their memory can't be trusted anyway!

## Hypothesis: Tenno are digital minds (busted) {#tenno-digital}

{{imgBox "/images/warframe/ordis.png" "Cephalon"}}

This was my original headcanon about Tenno before playing the Second Dream.

The Tenno are digital minds, which allows them to body-surf between Warframes. Let's assume they're run locally inside Warframes, because this has far more interesting implications compared to remote control.

The Orbiter maintains the "master copy" of the Tenno personality data. Each Warframe has a computing core capable of running the Tenno mind, but only one is allowed to run at a time. The active Warframe continuously uploads new memories to the Orbiter. Upon critical damage, the core self-erases and breaks the uplink; the Orbiter boots up a spare Warframe with the latest copy of the Tenno mind. The illusion of "self" is maintained by the continuity of memories.

Warframes lost during missions are looted by the Corpus or Grineer for experiments such as Zanuka. If the core was successfully erased, they get just the hardware. But if something went wrong and the enemy manages to preserve and boot up the core, Valkyr's origin story suddenly makes sense.

This more or less gets busted by the Second Dream. See [Operator Peaceframes](#operator-peaceframes) for an alternate interpretation.

## Hypotheses about the Zariman children {#tenno-children}

**Basis**. Ember's Codex entry: "Why would you put children on a military ship? ‚Äî We didn't."

Let's run with this!

### Hypothesis: Void temporal anomaly resulting in long journey

It's canon that spaceships travel through the Void, and the Void can cause temporal anomalies. What if the Zariman's journey lasted for one or several generations in onboard clock?

The Zariman being headed for Tau (see next hypothesis) implies it was a colony ship, likely with a lot of surplus space, supplies, and a large genetically diverse population inclined to breed. If the journey was taking decades, they would start having children out of boredom or to ensure the mission continues if the original crew dies of old age. Note that "military ship" doesn't mean "not colony ship": the Orokin empire was highly militarized, and if they were going to wage war, they'd send a fleet.

Various Codex entries, as well as remembrances in the War Within and Chains of Harrow, imply that the Tenno were a relatively tight group with similar ages, which makes them more likely to be generation 1 rather than N, because breeding times would diverge over multiple generations.

Getting stuck in the Void for one or several decades, with no apparent way out, could demoralize the crew to the point of madness. The synchronized craze doesn't need any special explanation other than mob effects. If the journey lasted for generations, educational and cultural decay could lead to mad suicidal cults. Note that the ship's systems could be run by a Cephalon, which tend to remain stable over hundreds of years; the crew could have lost any ability to operate the ship, kept alive by its digitized butler.

This doesn't invoke any unnecessary magic, and neatly explains why the Orokin hushed down the story: the risk of ships getting lost due to Void anomalies could demoralize the servant population, even if such occurrences were rare.

### Hypothesis: the Zariman did reach Tau

One of the dialogs mentions that the Zariman was headed for Tau, possibly to oversee the Sentients' terraforming efforts and start the human colonization.

### Hypothesis: the Zariman reached something other than Tau

### Hypothesis: adults turned into children

### Hypothesis: the Void made them

## Void entity hypotheses {#void-entity}

### The Void entity is manmade {#void-entity-manmade}

Chains of Harrow establishes that the Void has an entity associated with it, possessing a human-like mind and personality. This entity seems particularly interested in Tenno Operators, visiting their Orbiters and Railjacks to say hello and remind how we "owe" it.

Intuitively, a force of nature permeating the entire universe wouldn't have an mind of its own, particularly not something as small-scale and specific as a human. It logically follows that it originated from humanity.

Perhaps humanity's existence influences the Void, forming an entity or multiple entities that reflect it. Perhaps this is humanity's gestalt. Alternatively, it could be a specific human, similar to the Operators but much more "ascended".

This has obvious parallels with some other franchises; I'll let you invoke them yourself.

### Man-in-the-wall vs. Rell {#mitw-rell}

After completing Chains of Harrow and "freeing" Rell, an unidentified entity, seemingly Void-associated, begins visiting the Operators. Palatino and Rell make claims about some "man-in-the-wall" in the Void, which may or nay be the same entity. They claim that Rell was keeping MITW away from the other Tenno. However, MITW and Rell were never seen in the same room together. Further, we know that Rell has the propensity to haunt people when emotionally destabilized, as he did when spurring his Red Veil devoted into murder sprees.

One logical conclusion is that Rell, MITW, and our mysterious visitor are one and the same. We "freed" Rell, now he haunts us. One solid counter-argument is that Rell's autistic personality drastically differs from the visitor's extravagant, gallivanting demeanor. I've never heard of a split personality disorder where one half was autistic and the other was extroverted.

Alternatively, we might take their claims at face value. We "freed" Rell, now something other than Rell haunts us. It logically follows that Rell had its attention, and now we've attracted its attention.

## Stalker hypotheses {#stalker}

{{imgBox "/images/warframe/stalker.png" "Stalker"}}

Stalker's Codex entry and the Second Dream indicate the following: he survived since the Orokin times; he understands some Orokin tech, such as Void Keys; he doesn't know the nature of Tenno.

Known Stalker canon:

* Survived since the Orokin times.
* Bitter at Tenno for destroying the Orokin society.
* Low-tech weapons, ninja/samurai aesthetic. Apparent product of the Dax/Tenno culture, of the war with the Sentients.
* No indication of having Void powers. Retreats to a**void** death. Can teleport and dispel Tenno powers, but so can some Grineer and Corpus units.
* Attitude towards Tenno is akin to severe teacher punishing his pupils. Attacks Warframes but avoids killing the Operator in the Second Dream. May have lied to Hunhow about being ignorant of Tenno/Warframe duality.

### Hypothesis: Stalker is a renegade Tenno that woke up from the Dream and doesn't use a Warframe {#stalker-tenno-woke}

**Basis**. Lotus: "I was trying to protect you from the truth (about the reservoir). This truth drove Stalker mad."

### Hypothesis: Stalker is a renegade Tenno that's still in the Dream {#stalker-tenno-dreaming}

**Basis**. Hunhow to Stalker: "Do you still hate these abominations? Do you hate... yourself?"

### Hypothesis: Stalker is a Warframe that regained its mind, possibly a Dax {#stalker-warframe}

**Basis**. Hunhow to Stalker: "Are you asking yourself: was I one of those wretched things?"

### Hypothesis: Stalker is a non-Tenno human wearing armor made of Warframes, possibly Dax or Orokin {#stalker-human}

## The Orokin are made this way rather than born {#orokin-creation}

In The War Within, the Operator recalls some Orokin looking for beautiful young bodies to transfer into, via the Continuity process. Ordis' memories in the Codex contain a scene where the Orokin offer him to become one of them, implying a process involving Kuva.

## The Orokin society is still around, in the Void and/or other solar systems {#orokin}

## Baro gets his stuff in the Orokin market {#baro-orokin-market}

## Hypothesis: Tenno teamed up with Sentients to crush the Orokin {#tenno-and-sentients}

**Basis**. The Second Dream, Alad V to Tenno (paraphrasing): "The last time you got close with the Sentients, you destroyed an entire civilization. But you don't remember that, do you?"

## Derelict capture targets are survivors of Tenno raids {#derelict-capture}

The capture targets on the Infested Derelict will scream "I don't want to die!" and "No, not you, not you, not you!..". (All capture targets do, but hear me out.) Some are elites, equipped with a ridiculously powerful Glaxion that can melt practically any Warframe build in seconds. They must be veterans, survivors of Tenno raids on Corpus ships, who requested assignment to the most remote, most dangerous place, in hopes that Tenno won't show up... and then the Tenno show up.

## Cephalon Cy is corrhupted by Sentients {#cy}

Cy has memories of wiping out his ship's crew "to complete the mission" and seems extremely confused about what exactly constituted the mission and why it suddenly required killing the crew.

Obvious logical explanation: the mission was against Sentients; they hacked the Cephalon and overwrote the mission objective with "ensure death of crew by disabling ship systems while blaming enemies". Octavia's quest, dumb as it is, establishes that Sentients can remotely corrupt Cephalon precepts.

Various indications that Cy is either still corrupted or intellectually impeded in some way:

* Railjack build quality. Cy appears to have complete RJ blueprints. Instead of building one from scratch, he requires us to scavenge wreckage that's been rotting in the ground for several hundred years. Unsurprisingly, RJ feels paper-thin, easily punctured by ramsleds or regular stray shots. Perhaps Cy did this to create tension and feel useful, like a ship's captain barking orders to repair this, repair that, repel intruders, repair onboard hazards, and so on. A well-built RJ would make missions too smooth, and who wants that? Certainly not a viable command Cephalon!
* Prematurely ending Sentient exterminations. Upon reaching 20 Sentient kills aboard a Murex, Cy immediately declares "No further Sentient reinforcements are incoming. Mission complete." as the remaining Tau freaks are trying to melt your face and spawning pools are preparing the next generation of Brachiolysts. As if he's trying to stop us from _truly_ sterilizing the Murex.
