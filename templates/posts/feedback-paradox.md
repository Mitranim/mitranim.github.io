While authoring open source software and occasionally interacting with users, something struck me as peculiar.

To improve the product, you want to know your users. But how to reach them?  You want to learn how people use your software, their habits, problems, primary use cases, nibbling annoyances, and more. Ideally, you want to observe them using it, which is rather hard to arrange. Failing that, you'd like to talk to them. How?

Satisfied users don't come to talk. They're out there, on the other side of the globe, maybe on the Moon or Mars, happily minding their own business. They may be annoyed by a few things, but that's not enough to make them reach out to the developer. When a certain threshold of annoyance is crossed, they will look for workarounds or abandon the software. Only the rarest breeds, those who are simultaneously attached to the software, annoyed by it, and believe in feedback, will begrudgingly drag themselves to your feedback page and write a complaint.

At that point, you might have the user's attention until their problem is resolved or they reach an emotional timeout. An overly-simplistic, robotic view of the situation dictates that to maximize the amount of feedback, you ought to keep the user in the "annoyed" state until their timeout, wringing them with questions. Resolving the problem as soon as possible causes the user to leave sooner.

Of course, this is complete nonsense. Only a robot would think about humans in such simplistic terms.
