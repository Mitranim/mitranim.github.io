Title = Anime Impressions: Neon Genesis Evangelion, End of Evangelion

This post is highly subjective. It uses some affirmative language like "the show is A" or "the character is B"; that's just shorthand for "I think A" or "I feel B". Not meant to be affirmative.


The following popped into my head:

> By psycho, of psychos, for psychos

I don't mean to be derisive. A better term is welcome as long as the phrase is still catchy. Regardless, this is a gross oversimplification that doesn't tell you how to understand and enjoy the show. Let's dig deeper.

Most major characters are psychos. I recall only two semi-major characters who are well-adjusted and stable, namely Fuyutsuki and Kaji. I find this jarringly unrealistic since I never saw such concentrated groups of psychos in real life or even in fiction. At least you wouldn't expect this atop a military organization. Now, obviously, that's an oversimplification. Humans have multiple layers of culture on top of our subconscious, and anyone could snap with enough pressure, of which the show has plenty. Perhaps it's more precise to say that characters are frequently "unmasked", a naked psyche without the usual social "interface" that hides everyone's inner turmoil. I find myself interpreting this overarching character trait as a narrative device, a narrative style that shows the characters' deeper turmoil through their psychotic actions, not having to split the narration between action and inner monologue. Even though it's real in-universe, you could say it's metaphoric.

Even character development works differently from most other action shows. Usually characters start as wimps and gradually get better, with the obvious aesop about perseverance and the enjoyment of beating the odds. Eva doesn't do that; characters start somewhat broken and end up seriously broken.

These days, I consider myself fairly stable and satisfied with life. A fat cat lazing under the sun, metaphorically speaking. My two dominant emotions are satisfaction (with good ideas, good works of fiction, physical comfort) and disgust (with dumb ideas and dumb people). So at first I couldn't understand many scenes because they call out to certain emotional or interpersonal difficulties you may need to experience to "get it". It took some time after watching the show to recall, understand, and relate to many of those difficulties, at which point the scenes change from confusing or frustrating to kinda cool. It probably helps that most scenes involve attractive girls.
