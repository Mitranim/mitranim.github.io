For the last month or so, I've been absorbed by Astroneer (link: https://astroneer.space). It's an amazing game that released just recently (Feb 6).

I've started making video guides on it, tending towards more advanced aspects of the game that could otherwise go unnoticed or hard to figure out. The series, called Astrotips, has just started. Subscribe to my Youtube channel for regular updates. See you there!
