Talk about how in a well-designed game every feature should involve non-obvious decisions. Ideally, nothing should be a no-brainer. For example, gear for your character should have both upsides and downsides. Just making it hard to get is not enough of a downside, since once you get it, the gameplay ends: now you just always use this gear. Downsides mean that you'll have to always think twice before using it. They also create potential for interplay about negating the disadvantages.

This is closely related to the _gameplay conjecture_, which puts value on game elements that require thoughtful decisions.

Mention Darkest Dungeon, Slay the Spire, FTL.
