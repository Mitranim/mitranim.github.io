# Open Source

The free software I make for myself and other developers.

[stylific](http://mitranim.com/stylific/) <span class="fade">(LESS)</span>

A CSS library to help web developers make better websites. Somewhat similar to
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), but with a different, and dare I say,
better foundation.

[jisp](http://jisp.io) <span class="fade">(JavaScript / jisp)</span>

A "programmable language". Basically a custom dialect of Lisp that compiles to
JavaScript. I'm somewhat embarrassed about it, but people seem to like it.

[codex](https://github.com/Mitranim/codex) <span class="fade">(Go)</span>

Generator of synthetic words or names. You won't believe your eyes when you see
what it can make.

[gotools](https://github.com/Mitranim/gotools) <span class="fade">(Go)</span>

Collection of utilities for writing Go web servers: rendering tools, middleware,
database adapter.

[statil](https://github.com/Mitranim/statil) <span class="fade">(JavaScript)</span>

World's lightest, and possibly fastest, generator of static websites like this
one.

[datacore](https://github.com/Mitranim/datacore) <span class="fade">(JavaScript)</span>

An abstract library for clientside (in the browser) data modeling and ajax.
Somewhat similar to Backbone.Model and analogs, but with a different foundation.

... lots of [other things!](https://github.com/Mitranim?tab=repositories)
