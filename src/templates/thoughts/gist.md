Auto-didact with a recently found passion for software development.

Relevant experience — less than one year. During this time, completed a few solo
backend/frontend projects and have been a part of web frontend team for a
government-led program of bringing electronic education to Russian schools.

Authored some free libraries for web developers, including a CSS framework, a
site generator, a language, a framework for Go web servers, and various other
things. Guess it makes some lame kind of portfolio:

During the same period, developed a system for realtime monitoring, forecast,
and management of call centre workload (Node.js backend plus frontend), which is
still used in production by the client company.

Currently using Go for backend production.
