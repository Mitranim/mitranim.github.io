# Open Source

Free software libraries I make for myself and other developers.

[stylific](http://mitranim.com/stylific/) <span class="fade">(LESS)</span>

A CSS library to help web developers make better websites. Somewhat similar to
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), but with a different, and dare I say,
better foundation.

[codex](https://github.com/Mitranim/codex) <span class="fade">(Go)</span> as [foliant](https://github.com/Mitranim/foliant) <span class="fade">(JavaScript)</span> | [demo](/foliant/)

Generator of synthetic words or names. Check out the demo, you won't believe
the variety of combinations!

[statil](https://github.com/Mitranim/statil) <span class="fade">(JavaScript)</span>

World's lightest, and possibly fastest, generator of static websites like this
one.

[ng-decorate](https://github.com/Mitranim/ng-decorate) <span class="fade">(TypeScript)</span>

Bridge between Angular 1.x and next-generation technologies, such as ES6 modules
and application design patterns from Angular 2.

[datacore](https://github.com/Mitranim/datacore) <span class="fade">(JavaScript)</span>

Abstract library for clientside data modeling and ajax. Somewhat similar to
Backbone.Model and analogs, but with a different foundation.

[jisp](http://jisp.io) <span class="fade">(JavaScript / jisp)</span>

A "programmable language". Basically a custom dialect of Lisp that compiles to
JavaScript. I'm somewhat embarrassed about it, but people seem to like it.

[gotools](https://github.com/Mitranim/gotools) <span class="fade">(Go)</span>

Collection of utilities for writing Go web servers: rendering tools, middleware,
database adapter.

... lots of [other things!](https://github.com/Mitranim?tab=repositories)
